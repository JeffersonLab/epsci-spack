# JLab CE 2.4 specs
#
# In Bob's original ROOT compilation notes he lists the following
# features as turned on:
#
#  roofit minuit2 pyroot gdml unrun qt qtgsi mysql reflex cintex fftw3 soversion mathmore
#
#
# and the following as explicitly turned off:
#
#  shadowpw
#
#
# I added the following features as on (gsl and mlp are required by tmva):
#
#  gsl mlp tmva
#
#
# The spack root package file makes a subset of all features
# available so there is not complete control over the build 
# (unless we supercede the root package file in spack with our
# own). Reviewing the existing package file though, most of 
# these features are turned on(off) by default to match Bob's
# settings. The discrepancies are: 
#
# 1. The spack package.py file for root says support for qt.
#    was dropped after root 6.18.00 so we do not include 
#    qt or qtgsi
#
# 2. Neither the reflex nor cintex features are mentioned in
#    the package file or on the root website. I suspect they
#    were dropped some time ago (or were made non-optional)
#
# 3. The packages minuit2, pyroot, fftw3, and mathmore are
#    all turned on by the variants minuit, python, fftw,
#    and math respectively. Furthermore, they are all on by
#    default and so are not explicitly given in the spec here.
#
# 4. The mysql variant is turned off by default in spack so
#    I turn it on here.
#
#
# Note that jana2 is built with root support. It should have
# exactly the same spec as the root build so that another
# version of root is not built. We could force this by
# not specifying root explicitly, but only as a dependency
# on jana2. This is undesirable though since running "spack gc"
# to remove unneeded dependencies would then delete root if
# jana2 were removed for some reason. Not a likely scenario,
# but it seems better to make root a top-level package install.
